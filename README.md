# 8-bit ISA RAM expansion board with UMB support

This is my simple 8-bit ISA RAM expansion board. I created it to allow me to add UMB memory to a regular XT. It can also bring a 512k or 256k XT up to a full 640k.

- It is simple and easy to build
- PCB is small so it is inexpensive to have produced
- Desienged with KiCad
